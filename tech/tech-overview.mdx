  This recommendation list is a culmination of almost 7 years of testing every alternative in the market. Our recommendations are based on a combination of our own experiences and the experiences of our peers in the software development space. Do not confuse the simplicity of these recommendations with lack of testing. These recommendations are kept simple so that you can focus on building instead of wasting time figuring out which is the best tech to build your business.

## Website Development and Hosting

When building websites, I recommend solutions that are open source so you can **OWN** them, move them across hosting providers. After years of research and wasted money, I've decided on these services as the best way to quickly build, host and maintain websites.

    ### Why I recommend WP

    - Massive plugin library
    - Affordable developers
    - Massive reference library
    - 40% of the internet runs on Wordpress

    ### Alternatives

    These are a list of alternatives that come very close to de-throning Wordpress. Check them out if you're looking for something "different".

    1. Webflow
    2. Wix

  <Accordion title="Hostinger" description="Shared Hosting (High uptime, great features)">
    Hostinger is a hosting service that lets you host your websites, buy domain names, and email inboxes etc. They have very good servers and features. They offer a killer deal as well. [However, they recently (and secretly) announced that they were cutting back on the features they offered in each tier](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/10717644-new-web-and-cloud-hosting-limits).

    So when buying hosting, buy a long term plan (5 years or more) so you can lock in your benefits for the next 5 years.

    <Info>
      Shared hosting is great when you're getting started. However as you grow, and your brand becomes an asset, it's always better to "get your own server". Some people move to a cloud account like Google, AWS or Azure - but the smartest people simply have their own server.
